### The High School infrastructure is poor and misses the opportunity to improve its academic, administrative and humanitarian quality. Through an analysis of local and international information, budget shortage was discovered in this topic in addition to a large discrepancy in the opinion of students and teachers. Its impact has perpetuated the educational deficiency, and although new pedagogical mechanisms are generated, there are no objective parameters to evaluate an individual, their group, campus, region, state or country.
### We develop a web and mobile platform applicable to all higher middle education campuses (or their equivalences) in Mexico and the world, theoretically based on mathematical resources such as Game Theory, Chaos Theory and Graph Theory, eliminating Gerrymandering practice in academic assessments, enabling real-time public policy assessment, and applying ERP and CRM software concepts.
